Beneath the Boughs of Ancient Lore by Michael Hansen

Beneath the boughs where whispers weave
Through shadowed glades at summer's eve
The earth speaks soft, in rooted tongue
Of deeds undone, of songs unsung

The birch stands pale, the oak stands wise
With bark that holds a thousand skies
A path winds through the wooded deep
Where gods of yore and spirits sleep

The moon a silver sickle keen
Hangs low to bless the sacred green
And glimmers on the mossy floor
Where wild things tread forevermore

The air is thick with incense rare
Of pine, of sage, of autumn's flare
And somewhere in the rustling leaves
The weft of ancient magic weaves

A hare darts past with quiet grace
Its gaze a glimpse of timeless space
It knows the lore the bards once sang
Of holy rites where echoes rang

No temple stands, no bell does toll
Yet here I find the ageless soul
No pew but earth, no prayer but breath
No fear of life, no fear of death

For in this wood as dark as night
The wheel turns steady, true, and right
The seasons march, the seeds are sown
And I like them am not alone

So let the forest keep her creed
A hymn of stone and wind and seed
Beneath her boughs the old gods reign
And pagan hearts shall rise again
