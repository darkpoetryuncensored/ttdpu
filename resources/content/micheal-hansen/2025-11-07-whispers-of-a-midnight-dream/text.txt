Whispers of a Midnight Dream by Michael Hansen

In the hollow of the night, where shadows softly creep,
I dreamed a dream of you, beneath the veil of sleep.
The moon, in pallid splendor, cast a glow upon your face,
A phantom of my heart, enshrined in darkened grace.

Your eyes, like twin abysses, pulled me ever near,
A void of endless sorrow, yet a beauty I revere.
In your gaze, I saw the stars, though veiled in mournful mist,
And I, forever captive, by your spectral lips was kissed.

O love, you are a raven, perched upon my soul,
A harbinger of longing, a tale yet to be told.
Your whispers fill the silence, your breath a haunting sigh,
And though I seek to hold you, you are destined to fly.

Yet in this wretched yearning, I find a sweet despair,
For even in my torment, you are always there.
A love that binds in shadows, a bond of blood and tears,
We dance upon the precipice of never-ending fears.

And though the world may crumble, and time itself may cease,
In the quiet of the night, I’ll find you in my peace.
For love like ours is deathless, a ghost that shall remain,
Eternal as the midnight, and boundless as the pain.
