The Taste of You by Ashlyn Heffner

The night held its breath for us
Moonlight spilled like silver sin, and in the hush, your touch arrived like something holy wrapped in skin.

You didn't ask; you listened, to the language I spoke in sighs.
You learned the ache behind my voice,
the craving hidden in my thighs.

Your fingers traced a reverence
no priest could ever name
each graze a soft combustion,
each kiss setting blood to flames.

Clothing fell like petals, slow
not stripped, but shed with grace.
You undressed more than just my body
you met the soul I tried to brace.

My breath caught in the quiet,
where your mouth began to write
not words but waves of wanting,
like thunder tucked in night.

You found the places I forgot,
the tender parts I kept in shade.
And when I broke, I broke for you
and not once wished I stayed.

We moved like verses searching
for a rhythm past control.
Lust wrapped its arms around our hips
while love slipped into the soul.

Your name became a litany,
my pulse a rising psalm
I trembled in your worship and surrendered to your calm.

No frenzy--just a quiet fire,
a hunger deep and slow,
that grew with every whispered breath
until I begged, and let it show.

You weren't just pleasure, you were peace
a fever wrapped in grace,
the storm I'd always feared would come and longed for just in case.

We didn't race toward ending
we lingered, we adored.
Each second stretched like honeyed heat
with bodies longingly poured.

When I shattered, it was velvet
no scream.. no sound, just light.
You kissed the places still unknown
and stayed until they felt alright. 

Now even silence tastes of you
like wine beneath my skin.
You taught me how to burn with love and how to let it in.

And if I never feel again
what we became that night,
I'll still remember how it felt
to finally burn just right.
