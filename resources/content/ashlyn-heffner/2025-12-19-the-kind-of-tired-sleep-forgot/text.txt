The Kind of Tired Sleep Forgot by Ashlyn Heffner

I'm a tired that sleep can't fix
not the kind that folds into dreams
but the ache that sinks into marrow,
quietly unraveling the seams.

Eyes closed but storms still gather,
behind lids heavy with dust and dread.
The body lies still, but the mind keeps running down roads I thought I'd long since fled.

This isn't fatigue--it's a ghost in my chest,
whispering doubt through my every breath.
Each sunrise a promise I can’t seem to reach, each night a rehearsal for slow, waking dreams.

But even shadows wear thin in time,
even stone will crack beneath rain.
And there’s fire, still buried, dim but breathing, in the hollows carved by pain.

So if I rise, it's not with ease
not with grace or flawless stride.
But with a will that dares to move,
even when the soul wants to hide.

Some days I'll crawl, some days I'll burn,
some days I'll barely exist.
But I'm learning that strength isn't always loud sometimes it's just this:

To keep showing up with a shattered heart, to keep loving through the numb.
To be the kind of tired sleep forgot
and still refuse to succumb.
