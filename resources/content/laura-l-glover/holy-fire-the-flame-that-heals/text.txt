Holy Fire - The Flame That Heals by Laura L Glover

A divine thread, a stitch in time;
Intentional hands upon this loom of mine.
A weaver born between the spaces of thought,
A seer whose wisdom is sought.

A storm and the calm it later does inspire,
An icy blue holy fire!
A word used, not as a cage;
A word used instead to turn the page.

A voice once forgotten long in the past,
Then truth unto the ethers spoke at last.
Observation that shapes the grand design,
A ancient and deep witness to the mind.

From above so throughout,
A hushed whisper to a roaring shout. 
These are tools, in the toolbox of the soul;
And a wound that only you can make whole.

If you learn the weapons of command,
How to use your voice to demand.
That particles shift the way you see fit,
An orchestra from the throne you sit.

For look in the mirror and what do you see?
That it was you who spoke existence to be!
