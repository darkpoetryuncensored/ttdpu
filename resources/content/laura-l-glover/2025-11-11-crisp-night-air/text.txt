Crisp Night Air by Laura L Glover

I am the crisp night air,
and I smell like stardust.

I am the tiny snowflake,
rising and falling in the lilting melody of the wind.

I am the first blush of sunrise, whose gentle touch caresses your
face as you slowly emerge from a dream.

I am that slight, delightful quickening of your heart when something excites you;
the rush, the thrill of something yet undefined.

I am wonderous like the rainbow;
and every color that basks intimately on your skin.

I am the last sleepy thought before you fall asleep;
Soft, engulfing in warm embrace.

I am the raging thunder and the lightning it commands;
And with electric fingers I claim what I touch.

I am one lone teardrop rolling down your cheek;
Raw, hopeful, painful, and real.

I am the dark and lonely nights,
When you learned to call out my name.

I am the violent rush of the river,
Whose power thrills you.

I am the lone, wounded soldier standing there bleeding;
Torn, tired, yet exploding with power because I won.

I am the very first notes in a song,
Tantalizing, tickling your senses and awakening your curiosity.

I am a map,
I have been a lot of places and I am many things.

I am

I am you, and maybe you are me
