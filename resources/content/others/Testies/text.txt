In the velvet darkness, whispers call my name,
Shadows dance like lovers in a forgotten flame.
Moon-drunk confessions spill from trembling lips,
As midnight's secrets flow from fingertips.

Silent screams echo through the hollow night,
Where broken souls seek solace from the light.
In darkness we find truth, in shadows we reside,
Where poetry blooms from wounds we cannot hide.
