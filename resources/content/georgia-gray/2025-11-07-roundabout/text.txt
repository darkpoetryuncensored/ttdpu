Roundabout by Georgia Gray


My hatred for you has a home like no other
Grown from the rotting corpse of the obsession that once consumed me
The butterflies that filled me whole
Shriveled and withered away
Now line the gnarled teeth of the monster I've created
Sustained by your trite excuses and endless trails of disappointment
Enmity blooms from the bed you've made and refuse to lie in
My heart beats discordant with the thoughts that drown my mind
My hands have always been empty
You've only ever learned to take
And yet the grief consumes me
Despite
You have nothing I want to mourn
What a colossal waste you have been
And yet I'd do it all again
