Muffled Memoriesgoit by Georgia Gray

Silence drips delicately down
And nostalgia seeps insidiously through the cracks
Soaking the sheets with sweet sentiments of the past

A single tug on the strings
And your heart comes unravelled at my feet

With your broken pieces
I will build up y wall
Burning all the bridges that lead back to you
